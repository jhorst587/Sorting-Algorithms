This project tests several sorting algorithms by taking the average time to sort an array with a given number of elements. It was created to practice working with different sorting algorithms, creating file output, and compare runtimes of multiple algorithms. The sorting algorithms tested are bubble sort, quick sort, shell sort, selection sort, insertion sort and merge sort. Main.java has each algorithm sort 10 iterations of 5000 element arrays and prints the times each algorithm takes in milliseconds to the console. Performance.java tests the sorting algorithms and records the time in milliseconds in a separate file for each algorithm. Each file contains 50 times recorded (in milliseconds) for the algorithm to sort 5000 integers and an average of the 50 times. The last file contains the results of a shorter test of each algorithm (only 10 iterations, still sorting 5000 elements) and stores only the average of each of the algorithms' times.
